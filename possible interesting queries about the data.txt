Assume home team advantage for any given game to start framing our questions pertaining to game outcome.

Which game site has the most frequent inclement weather?

Is the home team more likely to win if a roof is retractable or fixed to be closed during incelement weather?

How much effect does wind speed greater than 10 have on a home team winning a match? (10 is decided as the arbitrary threshold in which wind might start affecting things like passes or kicks)

Which team has the best peformance in high wind speed/high rain weather?

Which surface type creates the most impediment when suffering from rain? (impediment measured by total score between both teams, ie a surface that is particularly prone to inclement weather would have a lower total score on average than one that is not)
